    "## Problem 1\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Preprocessing & Custom Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "    create_depth_abs_channels(image_tensor)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is critical. It calculates and adds two custom channels: one representing the absolute depth (a spatial linear gradient) and another representing image gradient magnitude (absolute difference of pixel intensity), improving the model's ability to locate boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resizing\n",
    "\n",
    "    X_resized = np.asarray(list(map(lambda x: cv2.resize(x, (224, 224)), X_train_ch)))\n",
    "\n",
    "Resizes all images and masks to the standard 224Ã—224 dimensions. This is necessary because ResNet50's pre-trained weights expect this input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Combined Loss\n",
    "\n",
    "    def bce_dice_loss(y_true, y_pred): return binary_crossentropy(y_true, y_pred) + dice_loss(y_true, y_pred)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the primary loss function, combining Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE), which handles pixel-wise classification, with the Dice Loss, which focuses on overlap and is better suited for handling heavy class imbalance (e.g., small salt masks)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoder Backbone\n",
    "\n",
    "    base_model = ResNet50(input_shape=input_size, include_top=False, weights=weights)\n",
    "    \n",
    "Uses the pre-trained ResNet50 without the final classification layers (include_top=False) as a powerful feature encoder, accelerating convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "U-Net Connections\n",
    "\n",
    "    concat4 = concatenate([UpSampling2D()(decoder4), encoder4], axis=-1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the essence of the U-Net architecture: it uses skip connections (concatenation) to merge high-level semantic features (from the decoder path) with high-resolution spatial details (from the encoder path).\n",
    "\n",
    "Decoder Block\n",
    "\n",
    "    def decoder_block_bottleneck(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses a bottleneck design within the decoder blocks to compress the feature maps before upsampling, potentially making the model more efficient and reducing redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation Split\n",
    "\n",
    "    kfold = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, random_state=1337)\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses Stratified K-Fold based on the custom coverage_class to ensure that each fold contains a representative distribution of salt mask sizes (coverages), leading to more reliable validation scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Best Model Saving\n",
    "\n",
    "    ModelCheckpoint('unet_resnet.h5' ,monitor='val_my_iou_metric', mode='max', save_best_only=True, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Only saves the model weights when the validation metric (val_my_iou_metric) is at its highest, ensuring the final output model is the best performing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Rate Schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "    reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau(monitor='val_my_iou_metric', mode='max', factor=0.5, patience=5, ...)\n",
    "\n",
    "Implements a dynamic learning rate schedule that automatically reduces the learning rate when the validation metric plateaus, aiding in final convergence and preventing overshooting the optimum."
